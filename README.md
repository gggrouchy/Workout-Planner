# Workout Planner

A single-page workout planner built using React.js. This application allows users to add, view, and delete workouts based on selected weekdays.

## User Story:
Create a space for the user to manage, track, and update their workout schedule for the week. The application allows the user to add descriptions for the workout as well as delete workouts as well.   (view)
We were motivated to develop this app as January is the universal month for new goals, especially fitness goals. We hope this application will aid the user in their ability to stick with their goals and create a healthy lifestyle.
